Senior-Year
===========

In Fall 2013, I had 3 programming classes. In Spring 2014, I have 4.
The languages used are C/C++ (Operating Systems, Networking), C# (Game programming, Software Engineering, Project Management), HTML/JavaScript (Web Programming), and SQL (Web Programming, Database Management). 

##CS 433 - Operating Systems
  1. [Assignment 1](CS%20433%20-%20Operating%20Systems/A1%20-%20Ready%20queue): READY QUEUE. A CPU alternates its processing power frequently between different programs, so that everything gets attention. The ready queue holds a list of jobs that need some CPU time. 
    * I use a heap tree to structure the queue, which will ensure that element 0 is always the most important job, and gets done first.
  2. [Assignment 2](CS%20433%20-%20Operating%20Systems/A2%20-%20Shell): SHELL. Works as a basic command-line shell, with two added functionalities: The 'history' command, to see most recently used commands, and "!n", to repeat the nth command used.
  3. [Assignment 3](CS%20433%20-%20Operating%20Systems/A3%20-%20Event%20simulation): EVENT SIMULATOR. Creates a bunch of events in a priority queue, and then simulates how they would get completed.
  4. [Assignment 4](CS%20433%20-%20Operating%20Systems/A4%20-%20Producers%20and%20consumers): PRODUCERS-CONSUMERS. Given a bounded buffer, and a user-specified number of producers and consumers, simulate how the buffer would fill and deplete.
  5. [Assignment 5](CS%20433%20-%20Operating%20Systems/A5%20-%20Page%20Replacement): PAGE REPLACEMENT. Simulates a computer's page table, with a page replacement algorithm (either FIFO or LRU), with a user-specified page size and memory size. 

##CS 436 - Networking
  1. Assignment 1:

##CIS 444 - Web Programming
  1. [Assignment 1](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw1%20-%20Tables/Tables.html): TABLES. Create a table with some information, including rowspan and colspan for headers.
    * Most of the CSS usage here (Alternating colors in the table, reactions on hover, varying fonts) is beyond the call of the assignment. 
  2. [Assignment 2](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw2%20-%20Definition%20lists/Plane%20types.html): DEFINITION LISTS. I explore the usage of definition lists.
  3. [Assignment 3](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw3%20-%20Javascript%20interaction): SUMMATION. Using JavaScript, prompts the user for an integer. It then calculates the summation from 1 to n, and generates a table for each step in-between.
  4. [Assignment 4](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw4%20-%20Sales%20form): SALES FORM. Presents a purchase form, with items and prices. Prompts the user to enter a quantity for each item, and will dynamically update the price as they go.
  5. [Assignment 5](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw5%20-%20Scrolling%20text): SCROLLING TEXT. There is a line of text that scrolls across the screen and flashes between colors. Because people love marquees from '90s websites so much that we had to recreate one of our own.
  6. [Assignment 6](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw6%20-%20Database%20query): DATABASE LOOKUP. Created a database with some entries. User inputs a team number, and this will find information about that team.
  7. [Assignment 7](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw7%20-%20XML): XML. Multiple small exercises using XML, DTDs, and XSL. Create a DTD for a car catalog, create an XML file using the DTD with multiple cars, create an XSL file for the previous XML document, create a CSS stylesheet for the XML, create an XSL stylesheet for the XML, modify the XSL stylesheet to apply to all cars.
