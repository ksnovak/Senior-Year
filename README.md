===========

I have three classes that require programming. I may as well throw their stuff on git.

##CS 433 - Operating Systems
######We're learning how to create programs for an operating system.
  1. [Assignment 1](CS%20433%20-%20Operating%20Systems/A1%20-%20Ready%20queue): READY QUEUE. A CPU alternates its processing power frequently between different programs, so that everything gets attention. The ready queue holds a list of jobs that need some CPU time. 
    * I use a heap tree to structure the queue, which will ensure that element 0 is always the most important job, and gets done first.

##CS 436 - Networking
######We're learning about how networks work, and how to write programs that work across networks.
  1. Assignment 1:

##CIS 444 - Web Programming
######We're learning the basics of web programming, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I already have significant experience with these, so I try to go beyond the call of the assignment to make something that actually teaches me.
  1. [Assignment 1](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw1%20-%20Table%20about%20trees.html): TABLES. Create a table with some information, including rowspan and colspan for headers.
    * Most of the CSS usage here (Alternating colors in the table, reactions on hover, varying fonts) is beyond the call of the assignment. 
  2. [Assignment 2](CIS%20444%20-%20Web%20Programing/Hw2%20Plane%20Types.html): DEFINITION LISTS. I explore the usage of definition lists.
