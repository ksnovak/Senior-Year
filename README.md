Senior-Year
===========

I have three classes that require programming. I may as well throw their stuff on git.

CS 433 - Operating Systems - We're learning how to create programs for an operating system.
  Assignment 1: READY QUEUE. A CPU alternates its processing power frequently between different programs, so that everything gets attention. The ready queue holds a list of jobs that need some CPU time. 
    I use a heap tree to structure the queue, which will ensure that element 0 is always the most important job, and gets done first.

CS 436 - Networking - We're learning about how networks work, and how to write programs that work across networks.
  Assignment 1:

CIS 444 - Web Programming - We're learning the basics of web programming, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I already have significant experience with these, so I try to go beyond the call of the assignment to make something that actually teaches me.
  Assignment 1: TABLES. Create a table with some information, including rowspan and colspan for headers.
    Most of the CSS usage here (Alternating colors in the table, reactions on hover, varying fonts) is beyond the call of the assignment. 
  Assingment 2: DEFINITION LISTS. I explore the usage of definition lists.
